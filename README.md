# Project 3: Spots

An image sharing website

## Description

I just created this website using Visual Studio Code which allows users to upload pictures of different places. The site features a simple and user-friendly interface where visitors can like and submit images, which are then displayed in a gallery format. Itâ€™s designed to make sharing and exploring location-based photos easy and engaging, whether for travel inspiration, personal memories, or community sharing.
